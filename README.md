## Build Steps

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To build it, change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/karamhawili/artist-search-app.git
cd insert-directory-name
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. (**Important**: Make sure the app is running on port 3000)
